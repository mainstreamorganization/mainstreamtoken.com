# Celebrating Bitcoin's Legacy with Mainstream Token Launch

{/* truncate */}

In a symbolic nod to the cryptocurrency that started it all, Mainstream Token ($MAIN) has chosen January 3rd, 2024 - Bitcoin's 15th birthday - for its official launch on the pump.fun platform.

Fifteen years later, we're honoring this revolutionary moment by launching Mainstream Token, a project that aims to bridge the gap between human and artificial intelligence in the crypto space.

## Launch Details
