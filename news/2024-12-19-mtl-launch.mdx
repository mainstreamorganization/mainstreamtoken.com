# Mainstream Token License Protocol Launch

{/* truncate */}

We are thrilled to announce the launch of the Mainstream Token License (MTL) Protocol! This marks a significant milestone in our journey to revolutionize digital rights management.

## What is the MTL Protocol?

The MTL Protocol is a parameter-based system that uses MT tokens to define specific rights and parameters for digital assets. It allows creators to specify the terms of use for their content, and provides a transparent verification system for digital rights.

## Key Features

-   **Parameter-Based Licenses:** Define licenses with specific parameters such as usage rights, duration, and geographic restrictions.
-   **Token Ownership Verification:** Access to digital assets is verified through ownership of MT tokens.
-   **Transparent System:** All license parameters and ownership details are recorded on the blockchain.
-   **Revenue Distribution:** Facilitates revenue distribution to content creators based on license usage.

## How to Get Started

Visit our documentation to learn more about the MTL Protocol and how to create and manage licenses.

Stay tuned for more updates!
