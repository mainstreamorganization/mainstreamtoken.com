# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Mainstream Token?
Mainstream Token ($MAIN) is an experimental digital asset on the Solana blockchain that enables decentralized digital rights management through the Mainstream Token License (MTL) protocol.

### How does the MTL protocol work?
The MTL protocol allows creators to define usage rights and parameters for their digital assets. Users must hold $MAIN tokens or follow payment instructions to access licensed content.

### Is this legally binding?
The MTL protocol is experimental and its legal enforceability depends on jurisdiction and specific circumstances. Always consult legal counsel for binding agreements.

## Technical Questions

### What blockchain does this use?
The protocol currently uses Solana blockchain but is designed to be blockchain-agnostic.

### How do I get $MAIN tokens?
You can purchase $MAIN tokens through supported exchanges or platforms. See our "How To Buy $MAIN" guide for details.

### What wallets are supported?
Any Solana-compatible wallet can hold $MAIN tokens, including Phantom and Solflare.

## License Questions

### How do I create a license?
Use the MTL Generator tool to define your license terms and generate a license string.

### How do I verify a license?
