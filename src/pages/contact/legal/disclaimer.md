PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE LEGAL DOCUMENTATION ("DOCUMENTATION") CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING OR USING MAINSTREAM TOKEN ("$MAIN"), THE MTL PROTOCOL ("PROTOCOL"), OR THE MAINSTREAMTOKEN.COM WEBSITE ("WEBSITE").

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE OR CONTINUE TO USE THE WEBSITE, $MAIN, OR THE PROTOCOL.

## 1. BINDING AGREEMENT

### 1.1 Acceptance of Terms
By accessing, using, or attempting to use the Website, the Protocol, or any associated services—including holding or otherwise interacting with $MAIN—You affirm that You are of legal age in Your jurisdiction and that You agree to be bound by this Documentation. If You do not agree with any part of this Documentation, You must immediately discontinue all use.

### 1.2 Entire Agreement
This Documentation constitutes the entire agreement between You and the Protocol (including its creators, contributors, developers, and affiliated parties) concerning the use of the Website, the Protocol, and $MAIN. It supersedes all prior understandings, whether written, oral, implied, or otherwise.

## 2. EXPERIMENTAL NATURE OF PROTOCOL AND TOKEN

### 2.1 Experimental Status
- $MAIN and the MTL Protocol are highly experimental
- No guarantees are made regarding functionality, stability, security, availability, fitness for any particular purpose, or market value
- The Protocol or $MAIN may fail, cease to function, or be discontinued at any time, without notice

### 2.2 Non-Financial Intent
- $MAIN is not designed or intended to serve as an investment, security, or commodity
- $MAIN confers no ownership rights, no governance rights, no economic entitlements, and no future rights to any asset or revenue
- Any perceived or secondary market value is purely incidental and is not endorsed or intended by the creators or contributors

### 2.3 Token Mechanics
- Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 $MAIN tokens, with no further minting
- Blockchain: Deployed on Solana
- Volatility: Price and liquidity may be subject to extreme fluctuations, especially given the bonding curve mechanism and decentralized exchange listings

## 3. USER ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

### 3.1 Assumption of Risk
By using the Protocol, holding $MAIN, or accessing the Website, You acknowledge and agree that:

- You may lose any or all $MAIN tokens or their value
- Blockchain transactions are irreversible and may be subject to errors, security breaches, chain reorganizations, double-spend attacks, 51% attacks, or other unforeseen risks
- The Protocol is experimental; it may fail for reasons including, but not limited to, code errors, community disputes, regulatory intervention, or security compromises
- No remedy, recourse, or restitution shall be available in the event of any failure, loss, or damage relating to $MAIN or the Protocol

### 3.2 Legal Compliance
You represent that using the Protocol and $MAIN, as well as participating in any associated activity, does not violate the laws or regulations in Your jurisdiction. You are solely responsible for any obligations related to taxes, licenses, or legal compliance that apply to You. Your failure to maintain compliance may result in legal or other penalties for which the Protocol is not liable.

### 3.3 No Reliance on Future Statements
You shall not rely on any forward-looking statements, projections, or information about potential functionality or market value, regardless of whether such statement was provided in error. Any statements made by the Protocol's creators, contributors, or community members do not constitute a guarantee of future performance or results.

## 4. VERIFICATION AND USAGE REQUIREMENTS

### 4.1 License Parameters
To maintain certain usage rights within the MTL Protocol, You may be required to meet certain token thresholds or other verification criteria. Records may be stored on or off a public ledger, and there is no guarantee of accuracy, permanence, or security.

### 4.2 Revocation of Access
Failure to meet any required verification criteria, maintain sufficient token holdings, or comply with parameters may result in automatic revocation or suspension of any and all rights, without prior notice.

## 5. DISCLAIMERS AND NO WARRANTIES

### 5.1 "As Is" and "As Available"
The Protocol, the Website, and $MAIN are provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" with no warranties—express, implied, or statutory—regarding quality, performance, non-infringement, or fitness for a particular purpose. The Protocol and its contributors disclaim any and all responsibility for:

- Service interruptions, errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in the code
- The accuracy, reliability, or timeliness of any data or information on the Website or related sites
- Any user errors, including incorrect wallet addresses, transactions, or other mistaken actions

### 5.2 No Advice
Nothing in this Documentation or the Website constitutes legal, tax, or financial advice. Consult qualified professionals before engaging in cryptocurrency transactions or relying on digital asset holdings.

### 5.3 No Guarantees on Market Value
$MAIN does not represent any form of legal tender, nor does it guarantee any inherent, redeemable, or real-world value. The market value (if any) is determined by third-party market dynamics outside of the Protocol's control.

## 6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

### 6.1 Maximum Extent Permitted by Law
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Protocol, its creators, contributors, affiliates, officers, employees, or agents be liable for any:

- Direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages
- Damages for loss of profits, revenue, opportunity, or data
- Damages arising from unauthorized access, hacking, or other third-party interventions
- Personal injury or property damage of any nature arising from Your access to or use of the Protocol or $MAIN
- Other losses of any kind, whether based in contract, tort, or any other legal theory

### 6.2 Aggregate Liability Cap
The aggregate liability of the Protocol and its affiliates, if any is found to exist, shall be limited exclusively to the number of $MAIN tokens You originally acquired, if any, and that no remedy of any kind will be provided, and specifically that no monetary payment, alternative payment, or compensation shall be provided or available.

## 7. NO REMEDIES; NO GUARANTEES

### 7.1 Experimental Protocol Failures
Should the Protocol or $MAIN experience total or partial failure, You agree no remedies are provided or guaranteed. There is no warranty, guarantee, or recourse of any kind, and no legal claim shall be considered valid. You bear all risks associated with participation.

### 7.2 Third-Party Acts
You acknowledge that no entity associated with the Protocol assumes liability for the acts or omissions of third parties (including fraud, hacks, or malicious code injections).

## 8. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

### 8.1 Independence from Legal Frameworks
The Protocol is decentralized and does not consent to any particular jurisdiction. You acknowledge and agree that courts or regulators may attempt to assert jurisdiction over the Protocol, but the Protocol, as a decentralized project, makes no submission to any specific forum or governing law. You acknowledge that no action of any kind may be brought against the Protocol in any court.

### 8.2 Voluntary Arbitration
At the sole discretion of the Protocol or its representatives, a voluntary, non-binding arbitration process may be offered to resolve disputes. Such arbitration shall not constitute a waiver of this Documentation's disclaimers, liability limitations, or jurisdictional independence.

### 8.3 User Waivers
You waive, to the fullest extent permissible by law, any right to bring legal claims in a court of law under any class action, consolidated action, or representative action procedures. If a court of competent jurisdiction deems this waiver unenforceable, the entirety of this dispute resolution clause may be severed from this Documentation at the Protocol's discretion.

## 9. SEVERABILITY
If any provision of this Documentation is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. The invalid provision shall be modified to achieve the initial intent of the parties as closely as possible while remaining lawful and enforceable.

## 10. MODIFICATIONS AND UPDATES

### 10.1 Right to Modify
This Documentation may be modified, updated, or replaced at any time without notice. Any such modification becomes effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of the Protocol, the Website, or $MAIN after a modification indicates Your acceptance of the updated terms.
