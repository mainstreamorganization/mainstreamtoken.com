# How to Buy Mainstream Tokens ($MAIN)

This tutorial will guide you through the process of purchasing Mainstream Tokens ($MAIN) to support the project.

## Understanding $MAIN

Mainstream Token ($MAIN) is a digital asset on the Solana blockchain. It is used within the Mainstream ecosystem for various purposes, including accessing licensed content and participating in community governance.

## Purchasing $MAIN Tokens

### Initial Distribution

The initial distribution of $MAIN tokens was facilitated through a bonding curve mechanism on a decentralized platform. This mechanism ensures transparent price discovery and initial liquidity generation.

### Current Methods

Currently, $MAIN Tokens can be purchased on decentralized exchanges (DEX) on the Solana blockchain.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Set Up a Solana Wallet:**
    *   If you don't have one, create a Solana wallet using a trusted provider like Phantom, Solflare, or similar.
    *   Make sure to securely store your seed phrase or private key.

2.  **Acquire SOL:**
    *   You will need some SOL (Solana's native token) to pay for transaction fees.
    *   Purchase SOL from a centralized exchange (CEX) like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken, and transfer it to your Solana wallet.

3.  **Connect to a DEX:**
    *   Visit a Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) such as Raydium, Orca, or Jupiter.
    *   Connect your Solana wallet to the DEX.

4.  **Find the $MAIN Trading Pair:**
    *   Search for the $MAIN token using its contract address or ticker symbol.
    *   Make sure you are using the correct contract address to avoid purchasing fake tokens.
    *   The official contract address will be available on the project's website and official communication channels.

5.  **Swap SOL for $MAIN:**
    *   Enter the amount of SOL you want to swap for $MAIN.
    *   Review the transaction details, including the price and fees.
    *   Confirm the swap transaction in your wallet.

6.  **Verify the Transaction:**
    *   Once the transaction is confirmed, verify that the $MAIN Tokens are in your Solana wallet.

## Important Considerations

*   **Slippage:** Be aware of slippage, which is the difference between the expected price and the actual price you receive due to market volatility.
*   **Transaction Fees:** Solana transactions have small fees, so make sure you have enough SOL to cover them.
*   **Security:** Always use trusted platforms and double-check the contract address before making any purchases.
*   **Volatility:** The price of $MAIN Tokens can be volatile, so be prepared for potential price fluctuations.
*   **DYOR:** Always Do Your Own Research before investing in any cryptocurrency.
