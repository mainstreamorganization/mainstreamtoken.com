# MTL License Verification

The Mainstream Token License (MTL) protocol uses a transparent and secure verification process to ensure that only authorized users can access licensed digital assets. This process involves checking the user's ownership of Mainstream Tokens (MT) and verifying the license parameters encoded in the MTL string.

## Verification Steps

1.  **License String Retrieval:** The MTL string associated with the digital asset is retrieved.
2.  **Token Ownership Check:** The protocol verifies that the user holds the required amount of MT tokens in their Solana wallet.
3.  **Parameter Validation:** The protocol decodes the MTL string and validates the license parameters against the current context.
4.  **Access Grant (future development):** If the token ownership and license parameters are valid, access to the digital asset is granted.
5.  **Access Denial (future development):** If the token ownership or license parameters are invalid, access to the digital asset is denied.

## Key Components

### Token Ownership

-   The protocol checks the user's Solana wallet to verify that they hold the required amount of $MAIN tokens.
-   Token ownership is verified using the Solana blockchain, ensuring a secure and transparent process.

### License Parameters

-   The MTL string contains all the necessary parameters to define the license terms.
-   The protocol decodes the MTL string and validates the parameters against the current context.
-   Parameters include license types, duration, revenue caps, geographic restrictions, and usage types.

### Smart Contracts

-   Smart contracts on the Solana blockchain are used to automate the verification process.
-   Smart contracts ensure that the verification process is transparent, secure, and tamper-proof.

## Verification Logic

The verification logic is implemented in the smart contracts and client-side applications. The logic includes:

-   **Token Balance Check:** Verifies that the user's wallet contains the required number of MT tokens.
-   **License Type Check:** Verifies that the user's intended use of the digital asset is permitted by the license type.
-   **Duration Check:** Verifies that the license is still valid based on the specified duration.
-   **Revenue Check:** Verifies that the revenue generated by the user does not exceed the specified cap or minimum.
-   **Region Check:** Verifies that the user is accessing the digital asset from a permitted geographic region.
-   **Usage Check:** Verifies that the user's intended usage of the digital asset is permitted by the license.

## Example

A user attempts to access a digital asset with the following MTL string:

```mtl
LICENSE: MTLv0.1-PC/100-5:20;+30D<1000000[US]{W}
sol@CRxe1dnmcECvAUZ4eL1GvwHJqRxqZhTYnUpJ8Y3pnYHc
```

The verification process would:

1.  Retrieve the MTL string.
2.  Check if the user holds at least 100 MT tokens.
3.  Verify that the user's intended use is for personal or commercial purposes.
4.  Verify that the license is still valid (within 30 days).
5.  Verify that the revenue generated by the user does not exceed 1,000,000.
6.  Verify that the user is accessing the digital asset from the US.
7.  Verify that the user's intended usage is for web purposes.

If all checks pass, access to the digital asset is granted. Otherwise, access is denied.
