# MTL Experimental Protocol Version 0 (v0)

This document outlines the specifications for version 0 of the Mainstream Token License (MTL) experimental protocol. This version introduces the core features of the MTL experimental protocol, including parameter-based licensing, token-based verification, and revenue distribution.

## Key Features

-   **Parameter-Based Licensing:** Licenses are defined using a flexible parameter system, allowing for a wide range of usage conditions.
-   **Token Requirement:** Users must hold a specified amount of $MAIN tokens or follow the payment instructions as defined in the parametric license parameters to use the licensed content.
-   **Revenue Distribution:** The protocol facilitates direct revenue distribution to content creators through customizable fee structures and revenue splits.
-   **Decentralized Rights Management:** Creators maintain control over their digital assets without relying on centralized platforms.
-   **Blockchain Agnostic:** The protocol is designed to be compatible with various blockchains or even without a blockchain, providing a flexible platform for digital rights management.

## License String Format

The MTL v0 license string follows this format:

```
MTLv0-<LicenseTypes>/<TokenAmount>-<Fee>:<Split1>:<Split2>;+<Duration><RevenueCap><RevenueMin>=<RevenueExact>!><RevenueMax>[<Region>]{<Usage>}~<Addendum>
```

-   `MTLv0-`: Protocol version identifier.
-   `<LicenseTypes>`: Combination of license type codes (e.g., `P`, `PC`, `PCD`).
-   `<TokenAmount>`: Number of tokens required.
-   `<Fee>`: Percentage fee for revenue sharing.
-   `<Split1>, <Split2>`: Revenue split percentages.
-   `<Duration>`: License duration (e.g., `30D` for 30 days).
-   `<RevenueCap>`: Maximum revenue allowed.
-   `<RevenueMin>`: Minimum revenue required.
-   `<RevenueExact>`: Exact revenue amount required.
-   `<RevenueMax>`: Maximum revenue threshold.
-   `[<Region>]`: Geographic regions.
-   `{<Usage>}`: Usage types.
-   `~<Addendum>`: Additional terms.

## License Types

-   **A (All):** Includes all types below.
-   **P (Personal Use):** License for individual, non-commercial use only.
-   **C (Commercial Use):** License for business and commercial applications.
-   **N (Non-Profit Use):** License for non-profit organization use.
-   **D (Derivative Work):** License allows creation of derivative works.

## Duration Units

-   `S`: Seconds
-   `M`: Minutes
-   `H`: Hours
-   `D`: Days
-   `W`: Weeks
-   `MO`: Months
-   `Y`: Years

## Revenue Conditions

-   Revenue conditions are optional and can be used to specify revenue caps, minimums, exact amounts, and maximums.
-   Revenue conditions are specified as numbers, and can be followed by `K` for thousands, `M` for millions, and `B` for billions.

## Region, State and Usage

-   Region, state and usage parameters are optional and can be used to specify geographic restrictions and usage types.
-   Regions are specified as comma-separated values (e.g., `US,EU`).
-   States are specified as comma-separated values (e.g., `CA,NY`).
-   Usage types are specified as comma-separated values (e.g., `W,M`).
-   Exclusion is specified with a `!` (e.g., `!CN` to exclude China, `!TX` to exclude Texas).

## Addendum

-   The addendum parameter is optional and can be used to specify additional license terms or references.
-   The addendum is specified as a string.

## Limitations

-   MTL v1 has a limited set of parameters and conditions.
-   Future versions of the protocol may introduce additional features and capabilities.

This document provides a detailed overview of the specifications for MTL v1. For more information on the other aspects of the protocol, please refer to the overview, parameters, verification, and payment sections.
