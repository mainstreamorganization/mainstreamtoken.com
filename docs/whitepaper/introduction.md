# Introduction

**Digital Rights Management Evolution:**
Digital content licensing systems remain fragmented and static, struggling to adapt to modern content creation and usage patterns. The MainstreamToken License (MTL) protocol seeks to address these limitations through a novel approach to token-based rights management.

**Protocol Foundation:**
MainstreamToken implements the MTL protocol through:
* A parametric licensing system for flexible digital asset control.
* Verification methods (future development) to ensure clear ownership.
* Revenue-sharing mechanisms (future development) to empower content creators.
* Platform integrations that provides greater accessibility.

**Technical Framework:**
The MTL protocol operates through:
*   Clear parameter structures that define rights usage.
*   A public verification system for transparent asset tracking.
*   Multi-platform support to ensure broad accessibility.
*   Community engagement components that help further evolve the project.

**AIDAMIS Integration:**
Market analysis, risk assessment, and strategic guidance will be provided through AIDAMIS (AI Dynamic Advancement with Mainstream Innovation Synergy), a council comprised of leading AI models. AIDAMIS is the core analytical and strategic framework for the MainstreamToken ecosystem.

**Vision:**
To create sustainable value through transparent, token-based rights management.

**Mission:**
To establish a secure and ethical digital asset infrastructure through community participation and innovation.

All technical details of the system and its implementation are available in the "Technical Appendix" section of this document.
