# Community Engagement

The MainstreamToken (MT) project values community engagement, transparency, and collaborative growth. This section details how the MT project currently fosters community involvement.

**Current Channels:**

*Official Platforms:*
*   Public discussion forums are available on the website for long term collaborative discussions.

**License Verification:**

For manual verification of licenses, users should post the following on the platform comments:
*   LICENSE: [LICENSE STRING]
*   PAY TO: [wallet address / pay info]
*   USAGE: [URL/LOCATION]
*   TX: [TRANSACTION ID]
*   REVENUE: [If Commercial/Derivative]
*   ASSET: [Asset ID]
*   PAYMENT WALLET: [Payment Wallet Address]

This same format should be posted on the official community channels for verification.

**Community Tools (Available Now):**
*   License Parameter Verification: The system allows all users to verify the validity of all licenses using data that is stored on the blockchain, including license parameters, revenue share, and expiration dates.
*   Usage Rights Tracking: Tools are provided to track usage rights and licenses by using public records.
*   Revenue Share Documentation (future development): All payments are tracked publicly on the blockchain, with tools to download CSV data, and information about all stakeholders of the project.
*   Community Verification System: A transparent system for community members to perform manual verification, and contribute to the growth of the system.

**Guidelines:**

*Verification Rules:*
*   Complete information is required to verify a license.
*   All data should be documented on a public ledger, or other data source that is readily available.
*   Transparent tracking of all transactions.
*   The community will monitor for any misuse of the system.

*Participation Standards:*
*   Use clear and concise language.
*   Provide factual and accurate information, based on real-world data.
*   Offer constructive and relevant feedback that is always professional.
*   Engage in respectful interactions with other members of the community.
