# Roadmap to Adoption

This roadmap outlines the strategic phases for the MainstreamToken (MT) project, from its initial launch to its goal of achieving widespread adoption, while focusing on concrete timelines and deliverables, and with transparency at all levels.

## Phase 1: Launch & Initial Implementation (Q1 2025)
**Timeline:** Jan 2025 - Ongoing

**Objective:** To establish the foundational elements of the MT ecosystem and establish an initial user base.

**Deliverables:**

*MainstreamToken Launch:*
* Launch the MainstreamToken (MT) on Solana using a bonding curve mechanism.
* Ensure a fixed supply of 1 billion MT tokens with no further minting.
* Provide clear documentation for the token and its utility.

*Core Implementation:*
* Document the core parameters and implementations of the MTL protocol.
* Implement the initial version of the license parameter system for creators and users.
* Create public methods for token holders to manually verify usage rights and licenses.
* Implement a clear revenue share documentation system, using token transfers.

*Community Infrastructure:*
*   Publish the official documentation for the project and its current limitations.
*   Provide clear usage guides and onboarding for all new members of the community.
*   Refer to the official website for community links: https://mainstreamtoken.com/
*   Establish official communication channels (e.g., Discord, Telegram, or community forums).

## Phase 2: Development & Community Growth (TBA)
**Timeline:** To Be Announced

**Objective:** To expand the technical capabilities of the system, while growing the community, and by also fostering community led improvements.

**Deliverables:**

*Technical Implementation:*
*   Implement a database-driven license tracking system.
*   Implement enhanced verification processes, that can automatically confirm data.
*   Create revenue reporting tools, so that users can track their revenue.
*   Develop new tools for community engagement and collaboration.

*Platform Enhancement:*
* Optimize the license parameter system to allow for more flexibility.
* Improve the efficiency of all verification processes.
* Publish and release all documentation for new systems.
* Improve the user interface for a better user experience.

*Community Growth:*
* Explore and document a method to bridge from MT to other platforms.
* Create robust frameworks that can help the community organize, and grow.

## Phase 3: System Refinement & Optimization (TBA)
**Timeline:** To Be Announced

**Objective:** To ensure all systems are functional, safe and sustainable, while also testing its capabilities for new features and future integrations.

**Deliverables:**

*Automated Verification:*
*   Develop and implement smart contracts for automated license verification.
*   Integrate off-chain data oracles to reduce manual overhead.
*   Establish a clear incentive system for community participation in verification.

*Platform Integration:*
*   Specify target platforms and technical standards for integration.
*   Explore interoperability with other blockchains and token standards.

**Deliverables:**

*System Refinement:*
* Streamline all the existing processes, with clear guidelines and documentation.
* Improve the overall system performance, making it faster and more reliable.
* Incorporate community feedback into all aspects of the system, and adjust as needed.
* Refine all technical documentation, with clear processes and best practices.

*Exploration of Future Integrations:*
* Research program systems, that can automatically verify the licenses and also automatically distribute revenue.
* Explore real-world implementation of the system.
* Explore new methods of data verification and storage.
* Explore other blockchain platforms and their integration with MainstreamToken.
