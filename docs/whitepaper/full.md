# MainstreamToken (MT) Details

## Token Mechanics:
- Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 MT tokens.
- Platform: Solana blockchain, chosen for its efficiency and low transaction costs.
- Launch: The initial distribution of MT tokens was facilitated through a bonding curve mechanism on a decentralized platform, ensuring transparent price discovery and initial liquidity generation.
- Minting Policy: No additional MT tokens will be minted beyond the initial supply of 1 billion, guaranteeing a fixed supply.
- Cost Savings: Leveraging a decentralized platform for token creation enabled the MainstreamToken team to allocate more resources to AI research, community development, and long-term strategic planning.

## Utility:
MainstreamToken (MT) will provide the following core utility within the Mainstream ecosystem:

### Rights Management:
The MainstreamToken (MT) platform will utilize various methods to grant access to the MTL protocol.

In the initial phases, the MT token can be used to:
- Verify license parameters and confirm user permissions through a community-driven process. These will be initially verified manually and recorded through various means, including a public ledger or other accessible tracking systems.
- Participate in revenue sharing through manual token transfers or other payment methods. Data will be gathered through community input and verifiable sources.
- Create a transparent and secure system for tracking licenses and usage rights through manual community participation. Records of this process will be made readily accessible through various means.

For example, an artist could use MT tokens, or other payment methods, to license their music, granting users access based on token holdings or other payment methods. Users could then use their tokens or other payment methods to access the music, and the artist would receive revenue through manual token transfers or other payment systems.

Future implementations of the system will enable the MT token to automatically facilitate revenue sharing through token-based programs or other payment systems. This is planned for a future phase of the project, and will be fully documented when available.

### Platform Interaction:
-   The initial distribution of MT tokens will be achieved through a bonding curve mechanism on a decentralized platform.
-   MT's price will be subject to the mechanics of bonding curves and may fluctuate based on buy and sell volume during the initial launch.
-   This mechanism will facilitate initial liquidity generation for trading on Solana DEX platforms.
-   MT tokens will be used to perform transactions and verification within the system.

### MTL Protocol:
- The MTL protocol utilizes various methods for decentralized digital licensing.
- Token ownership or other payment methods define specific rights and parameters through programs or other systems.
- The system enables a transparent verification system for digital rights.
- The MTL protocol facilitates transparent revenue distribution to content creators.

## MTL Protocol Overview:
The Mainstream Token License (MTL) protocol is a decentralized system for managing and enforcing digital rights using programs and the MainstreamToken (MT). These programs are typically written in Rust or C.

- Decentralized Licensing: The MTL protocol is designed to allow for the creation and management of digital licenses using programs, without the need for a central authority.
- Parameter Driven: The license_parameters object allows users to create and manage licensing terms, such as usage rights, duration, and scope.
- Tokenized Rights: The MTL protocol enforces usage parameters based on MT token ownership, creating a transparent and auditable licensing system.
- Automated Enforcement: Programs will eventually automatically enforce license agreements based on the parameters set by the owner.
- Revenue Distribution: The protocol facilitates revenue distribution using MT token, based on pre-defined conditions.
- Verification Process: The protocol defines how licenses and ownership can be verified using data stored on the blockchain.
- Modularity: The protocol is designed to be modular, so new types of licenses can be added easily in the future without causing any compatibility issues.

## User Interface (UI) Design:
The user interface will be built to facilitate both the creators and consumers of licenses, which will include tools for:

### Creator Interface:
*   License Creation: Set various licensing terms including usage rights, duration, and scope.
*   Asset Management: Upload and manage their digital assets.
*   Revenue Tracking: View their earnings and usage data.
*   Pricing Terms: Control what the asset will cost to use.

### User Interface:
*   License Discovery: Find licenses for digital assets they are looking for.
*   License Verification: View all details, and verify the validity of a license.
*   Access Management: Easily access and manage all of their digital licenses.
*   Purchase and Payment: Allow the easy purchase of licenses, with all payments secured via programs.
*   Revenue Distribution: Track who is profiting from usage of their assets (if they have them).

All technical details of the system and its implementation are available in the "Technical Appendix" section of this document.

### Data Processing Steps:

1. **Collect Data:** Gather all necessary information as defined in the JSON format, using web forms and other user inputs.
2. **Encode:** Convert all data to a standardized JSON string using the standard browser libraries.
3. **Hash User Data (Off-Chain):** Hash the user's identifiable information separately with BLAKE3, using a Javascript implementation of the algorithm, and store the original data securely off-chain to protect privacy.
4.  **Hash Copyright Data (Off-Chain):** Hash the copyright related information separately using BLAKE3, using a Javascript implementation of the algorithm, and store the original data securely off-chain to protect privacy.
5. **Hash All Data (JSON):** Combine all information into a JSON structure and hash the entire JSON string, using BLAKE3 in the browser.
6. **On-Chain Storage:** Create a transaction and store the resulting BLAKE3 hash of the entire JSON object in the memo field of the transaction using a javascript library (such as Solana Web3 library).

### Verification Process:

1. **Retrieve Hash:** Use a javascript library to fetch the BLAKE3 hash from the transaction's memo field.
2. **Retrieve Data:** Use a javascript library to obtain the structured JSON data.
3. **Hash Data:** Re-hash the retrieved data, using a javascript implementation of BLAKE3.
4. **Compare Hashes:** Compare the newly computed hash against the on-chain hash to verify the data integrity.
5. **Verify User:** The user must provide the private user hash, for verification of the user.

### Technology Stack:
**Programming Languages:**
*   Primary: JavaScript (specifically for browser environments). Frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular will be used to structure the application.
*   Programs: Rust or C for writing and deploying programs to Solana.
*   Hashing algorithm: BLAKE3, implemented in a JavaScript library for client-side use.
*   Blockchain Interactions: Solana web3.js library (or a similar library).
*   Off-chain Storage: IPFS or similar decentralized storage systems (accessed via JavaScript). This will be used to store larger files and content. It will be combined with pinning incentives for long-term storage.
*   JSON processing: Native JavaScript JSON parsing and stringification.

**Smart Contracts:**
*   Smart contracts for automated license verification will be written in Rust or C and deployed to the Solana blockchain.
*   The smart contracts will be open-source and available for review on the project's GitHub repository.

**APIs and Code Repositories:**
*   Specific APIs and code repositories for the hash verifications will be made available in the project's documentation.

**Performance Metrics:**
*   The system is designed to handle a large number of transactions with low transaction costs.
*   Specific performance metrics, transaction costs, and scalability strategies will be documented in the project's documentation.

### Key Data Considerations:
- **Timestamps:** All timestamps will be in the Unix timestamp format in UTC time.
- **Privacy:** All personally identifiable information (PII) will be hashed and stored off-chain to ensure user privacy.
- **Data Integrity:** The BLAKE3 hash of the entire JSON structure will be stored on-chain, ensuring the integrity of the data and that no part of it has been tampered with.
- **User Control:** Users will have control over what data is stored off-chain.
- **Long-Term Storage:** Although the blockchain is immutable, the long term storage of data is not guaranteed. For larger files, the system will use IPFS or a similar decentralized system, with pinning incentives for long-term storage.

# AIDAMIS Framework
(Artificial Intelligence Directive for Autonomous Management and Insight Strategy)

AIDAMIS will serve as the core analytical and strategic framework for the MainstreamToken ecosystem. It leverages a dynamic collective of advanced AI models to provide data-driven insights and facilitate informed decision-making, while maintaining operational transparency.

**Core Functions:**

AIDAMIS will focus on three key areas:

### Market Analysis:
*   AIDAMIS will monitor token market trends and price movements.
*   AIDAMIS will analyze token usage patterns.
*   AIDAMIS will evaluate community sentiment across different platforms.
*   AIDAMIS will track license parameter settings and effectiveness.

### Protocol Assessment:
*   AIDAMIS will optimize license parameters to maximize value and adaptability.
*   AIDAMIS will analyze verification efficiency to ensure seamless operation.
*   AIDAMIS will evaluate platform integrations and inter-operability.
*   AIDAMIS will monitor technical performance and system stability.

### Risk Monitoring:
*   AIDAMIS will track market volatility and potential risks in real-time.
*   AIDAMIS will analyze usage patterns for fraud detection.
*   AIDAMIS will verify compliance with legal and ethical standards regularly.
*   AIDAMIS will process community feedback to detect potential issues.

**Implementation:**

AIDAMIS will operate through:

*   Data-driven insights that will be delivered through a public dashboard.
*   Public documentation of all decisions and reports.
*   Community-accessible metrics and analysis tools.
*   Regular reporting and updates based on the data.

The AIDAMIS Framework is referenced in the "Executive Summary" and "Introduction" sections of this document.

**Governance Integration:**

AIDAMIS's insights will be integrated into the project's decision-making processes. While AIDAMIS will provide recommendations, human stakeholders and community governance votes will have the ability to override AI recommendations.

**Technical Foundation:**

AIDAMIS will operate using a combination of on-chain data analysis and off-chain machine learning models. The specific technical details will be made available in the Technical Appendix.
